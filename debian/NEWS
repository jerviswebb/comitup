    There will be an update of the key used for the comitup
    repository later in 2021. To prepare for this, if you use the
    repository to "apt" upgrade your comitup package, you should:
    .
      * Use apt to install the davesteele-comitup-apt-source package.
      * Delete any references to davesteele.github.io in
        sources.list.
    .
    Also, note that the default ZeroConf service name for the comitup
    host has changed from "workstation" to "comitup".

    The base_name configuration variable has been removed, and
    replaced by ap_name. The new variable lets you define the
    presence and length of the persistent random number in the AP
    name. See the comitup-conf man page or the install comitup.conf
    file for details.
